# ME-GIS

GIS files created by the ME-DEM team.

The ME-DEM project exists to create a high-resolution digital elevation model of Tolkein's Middle Earth. The users monks and SeerBlue created a number of GIS layers to support this goal. Some of that data is now available here, as the user jvangeld improves the data for publishing in a WMS.

The 10k DEM is available in .bt format from https://keybase.pub/jvangeld/10k.bt

If you want to use the data, just ask. We typically approve most personal and educational uses. Contributors are always welcome.
